# ESP-base

This is a Base Project for the ESP32 chip. The setup process can be a little annoying so this is supposed to ease this.

# Components
This project contains some wrapper-components for basic routines that will probably be used.
  - wifi: A component that wraps connecting to an AP.
  - udp: A component that wraps opening a udp-server.
